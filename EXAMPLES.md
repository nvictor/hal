# HFN Examples

This document serves as a workbook for HFN (Harmonic Flow Notation), demonstrating how to capture harmonic centers and motion across various song forms.

## Basic Examples

### Fictional song in A minor using all symbols
```text
Intro: =Am (Am =)
Verse: ⇄Am (Am ⇄ F)
Verse 2: ⊃Am (Am ⇄ F → Dm)
Pre: ↗E (Am → Dm → F → E)
Chorus: ⇄E (E ⇄ G)
Post: =E (E =)
Bridge: →C (E → F → C)
Break: =C (C =)
Final Chorus: ↗E (C → Am → E ⇄ G)
Outro: =Am (Am =)
```

Tonal roadmap:
`=Am ⇄Am ⊃Am ↗E ⇄E =E →C =C ↗E =Am`

## Common Patterns

### Holy Forever (Bethel Music & Jenn Johnson)
```text
Intro: ⊃Bb (Bb → C → Am → Dm → C)
Verse: ⊃F (F → Bb → C → Dm → C → Bb → F)
```

### Way Maker (Leeland)
```text
Intro, Verse, Chorus: ⊃E (A → E → B → C#m)
Build: ⊃E (A → G#m → B → C#m)
```

## Edge Cases

### What A Beautiful Name (Hillsong Worship)
```text
Intro: =D (D =)
Verse: ⊃D (D → G → Bm → A → Bm → C#° → D)
Chorus: ⊃D (D → A → Bm → A → G → F#m → A → Bm → A → G)
Bridge: ⊃G (G → A → Bm → F#m → G → A → Bm → A)
```

### Wings Of Death / Introduction (Jeroen Hippel)
```text
Intro: =Am (Am =)
Verse: ⇄C (C → B° → Am → C → B°)
Inter: ⇄Am (Am → Dm → C → Am → G → Am)
Chorus: ⇄Am (
    Am → C → B° → Am → G → Am → Em,
    C → Em → Dm → Em → Dm → Em,
    Em → Dm → C → Am → G → Am,
    Am → B° → C → Dm → Am
)
```
